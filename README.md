  Co-Extracting Opinion
 (I did this project 2016 as a University final year project)
  Compared to previous methods based on the nearest-neighbor rules, this model captures opinion relations more precisely, 
  especially for long-span relations. Compared to syntax-based methods, our word alignment model effectively alleviates 
  the negative effects of parsing errors when dealing with informal online texts.
